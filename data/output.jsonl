A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. BatchGetItem returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for UnprocessedKeys. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.  If you request more than 100 items, BatchGetItem returns a ValidationException with the message \"Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call.\"  For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchGetItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If *at least one* of the items is successfully processed, then BatchGetItem completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.  By default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem retrieves items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the ProjectionExpression parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.

{"prompt": "The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to BatchWriteItem can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB.   BatchWriteItem cannot update items. To update items, use the UpdateItem action.  The individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations specified in BatchWriteItem are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchWriteItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.  With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the response. If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, BatchWriteItem performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:  *  One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request does not exist. \n *  Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema. \n *  You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request.  \n *   Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).  \n *  There are more than 25 requests in the batch. \n *  Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB. \n *  The total request size exceeds 16 MB. \n  END", "completion": " aws-dynamodb-batch-write-item END"}

Also, there are per-table limits that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see Limits page in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*. Although you can increase these limits by filing a case at AWS Support Center, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The DescribeLimits action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those limits imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a limit. For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following:  2.  Call DescribeLimits for a particular Region to obtain your current account limits on provisioned capacity there. \n 4.  Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both. \n 6.  Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables. \n 8.  For each table name listed by ListTables, do the following: \n\t *  Call DescribeTable with the table name. \n\t *  Use the data returned by DescribeTable to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables. \n\t *  If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well. \n\t  \n 10.

For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly. But the only upper limit that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account limits.

You can optionally narrow the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. To further refine the Query results, you can optionally provide a FilterExpression. A FilterExpression determines which items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded.   A Query operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found, the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation.    DynamoDB calculates the number of read capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an application. The number of capacity units consumed will be the same whether you request all of the attributes (the default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection expression). The number will also be the same whether or not you use a FilterExpression.    Query results are always sorted by the sort key value.

The actions are completed atomically so that either all of them succeed, or all of them fail. They are defined by the following objects:  *   Put \u2014 Initiates a PutItem operation to write a new item. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be written, the name of the table to write it in, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for the write to succeed, a list of the item's attributes, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is not met. \n *   Update \u2014 Initiates an UpdateItem operation to update an existing item. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be updated, the name of the table where it resides, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for the update to succeed, an expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is not met. \n *   Delete \u2014 Initiates a DeleteItem operation to delete an existing item. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be deleted, the name of the table where it resides, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for the deletion to succeed, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is not met. \n *   ConditionCheck \u2014 Applies a condition to an item that is not being modified by the transaction. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be checked, the name of the table where it resides, a condition expression that must be satisfied for the transaction to succeed, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is not met. \n  DynamoDB rejects the entire TransactWriteItems request if any of the following is true:  *  A condition in one of the condition expressions is not met. \n *  An ongoing operation is in the process of updating the same item. \n *  There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be completed. \n *  An item size becomes too large (bigger than 400 KB), a local secondary index (LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error occurs because of changes made by the transaction. \n *  The aggregate size of the items in the transaction exceeds 4 MB. \n *  There is a user error, such as an invalid data format. \n  END", "completion": " aws-dynamodb-transact-write-items END"}

Although you can use UpdateGlobalTable to add replicas and remove replicas in a single request, for simplicity we recommend that you issue separate requests for adding or removing replicas.   If global secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must also be met:   *   The global secondary indexes must have the same name.  \n *   The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key (if present).  \n *   The global secondary indexes must have the same provisioned and maximum write capacity units.  \n  END", "completion": " aws-dynamodb-update-global-table END"}

After the index begins backfilling, you can use UpdateTable to perform other operations. \n   UpdateTable is an asynchronous operation; while it is executing, the table status changes from ACTIVE to UPDATING.

{"prompt": "The UpdateTimeToLive method enables or disables Time to Live (TTL) for the specified table. A successful UpdateTimeToLive call returns the current TimeToLiveSpecification. It can take up to one hour for the change to fully process. Any additional UpdateTimeToLive calls for the same table during this one hour duration result in a ValidationException.  TTL compares the current time in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL attribute of an item. If the epoch time value stored in the attribute is less than the current time, the item is marked as expired and subsequently deleted.   The epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.   DynamoDB deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure availability of throughput for other data operations.   DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The exact duration within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific to the nature of the workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.  As items are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index and global secondary index immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard delete operation.
